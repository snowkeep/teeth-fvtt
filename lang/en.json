    "ActionDescription": {
      "Aim": "When players <strong>Aim</strong>, they use poise, keen perception or sometimes patience to achieve precision. <em>They might nail a pheasant with a crossbow, flick a pebble into a bucket to distract a foe, deliver a paralysing chop to a guard's pressure point or toss a grapple up to catch on a parapet (but Manoeuvre might be more appropriate)</em>",
      "Command": "When players <strong>Command</strong>, they compel and intimidate. <em>They might threaten a servant to spill their master’s secrets, rally a mob of villagers to descend upon the witch’s hut, or rely on their air of authority to garner preferential treatment at the pub (but Persuade might be more appropriate)</em>",
      "Devise": "When players <strong>Devise</strong>, they fabricate a plan or construct. <em>They might rig up traps, manufacture explosives, manipulate complex mechanisms, compose music or determine a secret point of entry from the ancient plans of a manor (but Study might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Doctor": "When players <strong>Doctor</strong>, they use training and rationality to overcome cerebral challenges. <em>They might try to staunch blood flowing from a wound, explain a phenomena to a perplexed noble, treat a fever, or analyse a fungus to develop an anti-toxin (but Study might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Evoke": "When players <strong>Evoke</strong>, they employ words or symbols which have otherworldly power. <em>They might instil acolytes with zealous fervour, summon forth the dead to reveal the manner of their sad demise, control and exploit their own hideous mutation, or perform a conjuration by reading an evil tome (but Study might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Fight": "When players <strong>Fight</strong>, they employ martial skill in close quarters. <em>They might try to put a knife through an enemy’s ribs, wrestle a pig, tie a struggling tax collector to a chair, or simply annihilate an opponent with a headbutt (but Wreck might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Manoeuvre": "When players <strong>Manoeuvre</strong>, they perform or orchestrate a feat of physical prowess. <em>They might give someone a boost over a cemetery wall, make a quick escape by sliding across a slippery rooftop, amaze a crowd with a juggling act or launch into combat on the end of a rope (but Fight might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Persuade": "When players <strong>Persuade</strong>, they convince or win over with words and gestures. <em>They might deploy flattery to change a truculent bargeman’s attitude, concoct an elaborate but compelling lie, or pressure a noble into giving them a magical heirloom (but Command might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Scout": "When players <strong>Scout</strong>, they move warily and with stealth. <em>They might infiltrate a bank vault unseen, stalk silently through woodland, or emerge from the shadows to subdue a guard (but Fight might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Study": "When players <strong>Study</strong>, they probe, cogitate and analyse. <em>They might spend time researching in the library, glean evidence from a pile of bones, practise the mannerisms of someone they intend to impersonate, or contemplate the scuff marks on a desk to pinpoint a secret switch (but Surveil might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Surveil": "When players <strong>Surveil</strong>, they observe and interpret what can be seen and heard. <em>They might watch a crowd for signs of trouble, examine the landscape for evidence of a creature’s passage, look for hidden traps or keep an eye on the road in anticipation of ambush (but Scout might be more appropriate).</em>",
      "Wreck": "When players <strong>Wreck</strong>, they wield force with destructive intent. <em>They might charge a door with their shoulder to batter it down, cleave through the supports of a lookout tower, toss a wrench into the busy workings of a steam engine, or scuttle a boat with a bomb (but Devise might be more appropriate).</em>"
